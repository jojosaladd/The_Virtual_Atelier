# The Virtual Atelier: Interactive 3D Fashion Showroom
This is an interactive 3D fashion showroom built with the [Anigraph](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4620/2023fa/assignments/docs/assignments/c1/anigraph/) package. You can walk through the showroom, view clothing items, and express reactions. Anigraph is not publicly available, so this repository includes only the deployment code, not the full source.
